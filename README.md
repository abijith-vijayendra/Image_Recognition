# Image_Recognition
Built an Image Recognition system using Python and Deep Learning Library Tensorflow-Keras.
Features - 
1.) Built our own neural network model and played around with the model by modifying the structure by adding and subtracting different layers. Made use of Max Pooling, Convolution, Flatten and other network layers to build the model. Save the model and weights.
2.) Made use of Pre-Trained models such as VGG16 and Imagenet to extract features and used our exixting NN model to predict the targets.
3.) Used Binary Cross Entropy as our loss function and 'adam' optimizer to measure accuracy
4.) Implemented Transfer Learning
